# bank-app-demo
Hi, welcome to my github account, nice to see you!

  I will mention that this is not my own project, it's a project from Udemy course, but I considered to put here because it was a work where I tried on my own to create this small project with some indications! 

About this app-demo: 

There are 2 "clients" in this Bank: 

Jonas Schedtmann and Jessica Davis and there is a Log In page where they connect with the first letter of their names "js" and "jd"

When they connect to the account they have : 

- a transactional history with their transactions 
- an option to transfer money to each other 
- an option to loan money if in their transactional history exist a sum of money that is 10% from their loan
- an option to delete the account
- a timer if they do not do an action in 5 minutes and the account is logged out 
- a small evidence about how much money they deposit it , how much withdrawals they have and interest rate

This project put a lot accent on ES6 features and I learned the essential elements from this .
